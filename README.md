# pg_index_project
Houses code/data used for the PG index project, spearheaded by Z-Stat at UNC-CH. 

The goal of this project was to develop a unique metric to assess point guard performance in the NBA. In this repository, I have included some code that I used to scrape relevant data from stats.nba.com (as well as basketball-reference.com) as well as the scraped data, which needs to be organized into a single dataset. 

*Update (June 2017)*: Unfortunately, Z-Stat has essentially been dissolved, killing the project.
